        "author": "Oscar Wilde",
        "content": "Once there was a giant \n\n\n\n\n who owned a beautiful garden. The local children loved to play there every day, but one day the giant returned after being away for a long time. He was angry to find the children playing in his garden and decided to build a high wall to keep them out. After that, the garden became cold and covered with snow, as if it were stuck in an eternal winter.\n\nWithout the children's laughter and joy, the garden was lifeless. The trees and flowers refused to bloom, and the birds stopped singing. The giant began to feel lonely and sad. One day, he saw the children sneaking in through a small hole in the wall, and he realized how much he had missed their laughter. The moment he allowed them back into the garden, the snow melted, the trees began to blossom, and the birds returned to sing.\n\nThe giant was filled with happiness as he saw the garden come to life again. From then on, he welcomed the children every day and shared his garden with them. As time passed, the giant grew old. One day, he saw a small child whom he had helped long ago, standing in a corner of the garden. The child smiled at him, and the giant knew that he had been forgiven. The child told him, 'You have earned a place in Heaven.'\n\nAnd so, the giant passed away, and his garden remained full of life and joy forever."
